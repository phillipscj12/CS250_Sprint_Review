# CS 250 - Sprint Review and Retrospective Submission

## Overview
This repository contains my **Sprint Review and Retrospective** document for CS 250. This submission demonstrates my understanding of **Agile and Scrum practices** as applied to software development.

## Sprint Review and Retrospective
- **Sprint Review:** Evaluates the final sprint of my project, including the completed work, backlog updates, and stakeholder feedback.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflects on my sprint experience, what went well, areas for improvement, and strategies for future Agile development.

## Essential Questions Reflection

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs is a critical aspect of software development. I use techniques such as **gathering requirements, conducting user interviews, and analyzing use cases** to understand the end-user’s goals.

Creating **user stories** helps break down these needs into manageable, functional requirements. Each user story follows a **“Who, What, Why”** structure:
- **Who:** Identifies the user role  
- **What:** Describes the specific feature or functionality  
- **Why:** Explains the purpose or value of the feature  

By structuring development around **user stories**, I ensure that my code aligns with **real-world user expectations** and delivers value.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach software development using an **iterative and incremental** mindset. I follow **Agile methodologies**, particularly:
- **Breaking work into small, achievable tasks** to maintain progress and avoid roadblocks.
- **Working in sprints**, where I focus on developing, testing, and refining small sections of a program before moving on.
- **Prioritizing user feedback**, allowing for continuous improvement.

For my future development work, I hope to further incorporate:
- **Daily stand-up meetings (even in solo projects)** to track progress and blockers.
- **Test-driven development (TDD)** to write more reliable and maintainable code.
- **Pair programming and code reviews** to enhance collaboration and improve code quality.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development is **collaborative, communicative, and adaptable**. Key aspects include:
- **Effective communication**: Sharing progress, challenges, and ideas with team members.
- **Willingness to give and receive feedback**: Constructive feedback improves both individual and team performance.
- **Accountability**: Taking ownership of assigned tasks and completing them on time.
- **Adaptability**: Being open to changing requirements and new technologies.

By practicing **active participation, respect, and continuous learning**, I aim to be a **reliable and valuable** team player in any development setting.
